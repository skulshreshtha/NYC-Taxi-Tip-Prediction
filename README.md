# NYC-Taxi-Tip-Prediction
Using PyCaret Regression Module to predict tip as a % of total fare for NYC taxi trips

# Objective
I will be trying to predict the tip amount as % of the total fare for NYC Yellow taxi cabs

# Data Used
Though the entire analysis can be replicated for any time period, I am using January 2017 data for my analysis & modelling

# Evaluation
To evaluate different models, I would be using RMSE and R<sup>2</sup> as the evaluation metric
